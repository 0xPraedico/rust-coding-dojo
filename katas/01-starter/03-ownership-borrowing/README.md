## How to run a kata
All katas share the same structure:
```
/XX-package/XX-kataname
|- src
   |- bin
      |- exercise_1.rs
      |- exercise_2.rs
   main.rs
   ...
|- solutions
   |- exercise_1.rs
   |- exercise_2.rs
   ...
Cargo.lock
Cargo.toml
```
The kata may consist in a single program with gaps, then we put the program source in the `src` folder at kata's root, and the main function in `src/main.rs`. Then, it can just be run by calling the command `cargo run`.

If the kata consists in several small exercise programs, we put all the exercises in a `src/bin` folder at kata's root.
We can just run the exercise by calling `cargo run --bin <exercise_n>` to run the targeted exercise, without needing the others to compile, or to comment anything. 


## Prerequisites
The SETUP package must have been completed
