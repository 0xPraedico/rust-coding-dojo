/**
 * Section 1 : Introduction
 * - *Exercise 1:* Define an Enum BookType with some kinds like `comic`, `sf` or `novel`.
 * - *Exercise 2:* Define a struct `Book` with fields for title, author, book type and publication year. Instantiate an instance and print its details
 * - *Exercise 3:* Create a struct `Library` containing a vector of `Book` instances. Write a function to display all books in the library.
 * - *Exercise 4:* Extend the `Book` struct with a method to calculate the age of the book based on the current year. Display the age of each book in the library.
 *
 * Define in this module the types, methods and function and use them in `main.rs`.
 * The exercises in this coding dojo are designed to progressively increase in difficulty.
