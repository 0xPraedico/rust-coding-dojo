/**
 * Section 3 : Pattern Matching
 * - *Exercise 1:* Create a function to check if a given number is prime, using pattern matching for different cases (prime, non-prime).
 * - *Exercise 2:* Implement a program that categorizes a list of integers into three groups: positive, negative, and zero.
 * - *Exercise 3:* Define an enum `Shape` with variants for Circle and Square. Write a function that calculates the area based on the shape and relevant parameters.
 *
 * Define in this module the types, methods and function and use them in `main.rs`.
 * The exercises in this coding dojo are designed to progressively increase in difficulty.
