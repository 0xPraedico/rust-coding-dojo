/**
 * Section 4 : Basics of Traits
 * - *Exercise 1:* Define a trait `MathOperation` with a method to perform a basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.). Implement the trait for a custom struct.
 * - *Exercise 2:* Create a generic function that takes a vector of any type implementing the `Display` trait and prints each element.
 * - *Exercise 3:* Define a trait `Sortable` with a method to sort a vector. Implement the trait for a custom struct that contains a vector of integers. *
 *
 * Define in this module the types, methods and function and use them in `main.rs`.
 * The exercises in this coding dojo are designed to progressively increase in difficulty.
